      // Objects allow you to store data and functions. Unlike arrays,
      // they are not ordered, and so do not use indexes at all for
      // retrieving or modifying their values. Instead they use keys and values
      // to store pointers to data.
      //
      // Have a read through the documentation here before you begin: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_objects.asp
      // The documentation mentions methods, which is where you assign a
      // function to a key in the object. We'll be focusing entirely on the more simple
      // version it mentioned; properties.

      // Task 1: Below is a variable called person which has an object assigned to it.
      // The object has one property with the key (studentAt) which has a string "Technigo" as its
      // value. Add two more properties (keys and values) to the object; one called name which
      // should store your name as a string, and one called age which should store
      // your age as a number.
      class Person {

          };

      const person2 = new Person("Technigo", "Fredrik", 42);

      person.printInfo();

      console.log(person);
      console.log(person2);

      // Task 2: Add a fourth property to the object using the key `favoriteFoods`. Its value
      // should be an array of strings with some foods you like.
      person.favoriteFoods = ["Pad Grapao Nua", "Gong Bao Ji", "Shui Zhu Niu"];

      // Task 3: Use the dot notation to print the name and age properties from the person
      // object using console.log.
      console.log(person.name);
      console.log(person.age);

      // Task 4: You can add a property to an object using the dot notation and using assignment to
      // set a its value. Do this to add a new property to the person object with the key `eyeColor`
      // and value being a string with the color of your eyes.

      person.eyeColor = "Blue";

      // Task 5: Objects can be nested within other objects. To fetch a value, you must chain
      // the dot notation. For example, you could select the entire `adult` object from the
      // `dog` object below using the notation `dog.labrador.adult`. Using the dog object below,
      // use console.log() to print the name of the puppy (so it should print "Buster").
