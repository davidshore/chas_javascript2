  // Objects allow you to store data and functions. Unlike arrays,
  // they are not ordered, and so do not use indexes at all for
  // retrieving or modifying their values. Instead they use keys and values
  // to store pointers to data.
  //
  // Have a read through the documentation here before you begin: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_objects.asp
  // The documentation mentions methods, which is where you assign a
  // function to a key in the object. We'll be focusing entirely on the more simple
  // version it mentioned; properties.

  // Task 1: Below is a variable called person which has an object assigned to it.
  // The object has one property with the key (studentAt) which has a string "Technigo" as its
  // value. Add two more properties (keys and values) to the object; one called name which
  // should store your name as a string, and one called age which should store
  // your age as a number.

  class Person {
    constructor(studentAt, name, age, favouriteFoods){
      this.studentAt = studentAt;
      this.name = name;
      this.age = age;
      this.favouriteFoods = favouriteFoods;
    }

    printNameAge(){
      console.log(`Name: ${this.name}. Age: ${this.age}`)
    }
  }

  const person = new Person('Technigo', 'Linn√©a Svensson', 33, ['Sushi', 'Ramen', 'Fried Rice'])

  console.log(person);

  // Task 2: Add a fourth property to the object using the key `favoriteFoods`. Its value
  // should be an array of strings with some foods you like.


  // Task 3: Use the dot notation to print the name and age properties from the person
  // object using console.log.

  person.printNameAge();


  // Task 4: You can add a property to an object using the dot notation and using assignment to
  // set a its value. Do this to add a new property to the person object with the key `eyeColor`
  // and value being a string with the color of your eyes.

  person.eyeColor = 'brown';
  console.log(person.eyeColor);


  // Task 5: Objects can be nested within other objects. To fetch a value, you must chain
  // the dot notation. For example, you could select the entire `adult` object from the
  // `dog` object below using the notation `dog.labrador.adult`. Using the dog object below,
  // use console.log() to print the name of the puppy (so it should print "Buster").

  class Dogs {
    constructor(adultName, puppyName){
      this.labrador = {
        adult: {
          name: adultName
        },
        puppy: {
          name: puppyName
        }
      }
    }
  }

  const dogs = new Dogs('Marley', 'Buster');

  console.log(dogs);

  //OR

  // class Dogs {
  //   constructor(breed){
  //     this.breed = breed;
  //   }
  // }

  // const dogs = new Dogs({labradore: {adult: {name: 'Marley'}, puppy: {name: 'Buster'}}});

  // console.log(dogs.breed);
